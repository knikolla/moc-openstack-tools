Hi <FULLNAME>,

A user account has been created for you on MOC Production (Kaizen).  Your username is "<USERNAME>".  You will receive a separate email with a link to set your password. The link will expire after 48 hours, so please act promptly. If your link expires, you may request a new link using the following form:
<PASSWORD_RESET_FORM_URL>

Once your password is set, you can log in at:
<LOGIN_URL>

You have been added to the OpenStack project: <PROJECT>.

Make sure to review the following page outlining our terms, expectations, and default project settings.  Please pay particular attention to the security expectations.  Note that any VM that appears to be compromised will be shut down without warning. 
<TERMS_URL>

We also suggest you take the following steps to prevent lost data / wasted work:

1. The cloud images provided by MOC do not have a default password. Set one in your instances, so that you can log into into the console from the web interface for troubleshooting.

2. Keep a separate backup of any critical data in your OpenStack instances.  Our Ceph Storage backend includes multiple copies of cluster data, but we don't currently maintain a secondary disaster-recovery backup.  

More information on getting started with OpenStack can be found here:
<GETTING_STARTED_URL>

If you have any questions, or if you encounter any issues with your account or project, please log a ticket at:
<SUPPORT_EMAIL>

Thanks,
The MOC Team
