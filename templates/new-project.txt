Hi <FULLNAME>,

The new OpenStack project `<PROJECT>` has been created for you on MOC Production (Kaizen).  You can log in at:
<LOGIN_URL>.  

If you also requested a new user account, you will receive the details in a separate email.

Make sure to review the following page outlining our terms, expectations, and default project quotas.  Please pay particular attention to the security expectations.  Note that any VM that appears to be compromised will be shut down without warning.

We also suggest you take the following steps to prevent lost data / wasted work:

1. The cloud images provided by MOC do not have a default password. Set one in your instances, so that you can log into into the console from the web interface for troubleshooting.

2. Keep a separate backup of any critical data in your OpenStack instances.  Our Ceph Storage backend includes multiple copies of cluster data, but we don't currently maintain a secondary disaster-recovery backup.  

More information on getting started with OpenStack can be found here:
<GETTING_STARTED_URL>

If you have any questions, or if you encounter any issues with your account or project, please log a ticket at:
<SUPPORT_EMAIL>

Thanks,
The MOC Team
